# cipher-code
This program enables user to encode and decode. 
If the user does not know the shift value this would create decoded statements of all the shift values
Note: positive shift values moves the text backwards
        eg: "A" with shift = 1 means "Z"
        likewise "A" with shift = -1 means "B"
Cipher_code.py decodes text from command line 
cipher_file.py decodes text from files
